# Python_Port_Scanner
A Port Scanner programmed in Python 3.6. This is a Network Recon tool, and its purpose is to find weak access points on a server/host. The program asks for a target, and whether the user wishes to see closed ports. After user input, the program probes the target server or host for open ports.
